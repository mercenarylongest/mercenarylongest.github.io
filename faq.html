<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<hr>
<h2>what is /rwby/?</h2>
/rwby/ is the <a href="https://8chan.moe/rwby">8chan board dedicated to RWBY</a>. it's attempting to be the home of anonymous RWBY discussion, and frankly i support it. 4chan has only gotten worse and worse to post on as time goes on, both from a social and mechanical standpoint. i see 8chan's /rwby/ as a functional upgrade (the site is usable without external scripts & it has at least one mod who actually gives a shit) and i think you should at least try it out.

<h2>what day do new episodes come out?</h2>
VIZ has acquired RWBY, but they're taking their sweet time with it. no ETA

<h2>what day do new episodes come out?</h2>
currently, since Rooster Teeth is dead, RWBY is up in the air. no new episodes, possibly ever.
	
<h2>should i watch the show?</h2>
the show isn't good. it can be very bad, but sometimes it can really shine. most of the time it's just meh.<br>
just binge it a little, and if you start disliking it, just stop. do what is fun<br>

<h2>how can i request something to be added to the links page or website?</h2>
use <a href="https://github.com/mercenarylongest/mercenarylongest.github.io">the github repository</a> and submit an issue or contact me via discord (blakeplusplus)

<h2>why can't i read these comics? what's a .cbr/.cbz file?</h2>
cbr and cbz files are a comic book format file specifically for...comic books. works really well. you need an image viewer that can browse these. i personally used to use <a href="https://nomacs.org/">nomacs</a>

<h2>how do i make my own webms/gifs of RWBY?</h2>
I use <a href="https://mpv.io/">mpv, a free open-source media player</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ekisu/mpv-webm">a webm converter plugin for mpv</a> to easily make webms out of downloaded RWBY episodes. If you are masochistic/love a good command line, you can use <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>. You can also use <a href="https://gitgud.io/nixx/WebMConverter">WebMConverter</a> if you don't like command line. For gifs only, you can use <a href="https://glqv.bitbucket.io/rwby/gif-maker/">GLQ's GIFmaker</a> to pull from any episode publicly available.<br>
If any of this is too difficult for you, just request something in the thread.

<h2>who uploads the stuff to the MEGA links?</h2>
random people pretty much

<h2>i'm looking for a specific thing that the pastebin doesn't have</h2>
i will likely have it. contact me via discord or put an issue on the github page

<h2>who are you?</h2>
blakeplusplus<br>

<h2>last /co/ general?</h2>
2534.

<h2>why does /rwbyg/ go to /trash/ during hiatus?</h2>
tl;dr some asshole that hated people doing greentext stories in RWBY /co/ threads focused his powers to spam other threads and get rwbyg banned off of /co/ during hiatus
