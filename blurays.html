<h1>Overview</h1>
Ripped directly from BluRay, encoded through Handbrake. H.265 1080p, framerate set same as source.<br>
This rip uses the .mkv file format, with all CRWBY commentaries contained on separate audio tracks. You <strong>WILL</strong> need a video player that can play .mkvs.<br>
<strong>Support the original creators please.</strong>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Why are all these files not in mp4 format? I can't play them?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> MKV offers the excellent advantage of being able to select audio tracks and subtitle tracks, while MP4 does not. For these files, you need to be able to select audio tracks to switch between crew/cast/whatever commentary version and original dub. Download VLC, MPV, or any media player that supports MKV. Otherwise, you will NOT be able to watch the crew commentaries. <strong>No exceptions.</strong><br><br>


<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Why are there not multiple subtitle languages in a lot of files?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> RT didn't put them in, and it's simply a massive undertaking that I cannot do alone. To put it into perspective:
<ul>
	<li> I would have to singlehandedly add 4 different subtitle languages for every single episode.</li>
	<li> Since the opening is removed in these files, I have to retime the subtitles to start and end sooner, and work around ads.</li>
	<li> I would have to add new subtitles for any scenes not present in the online versions.</li>
	<li> I would have to confirm in every episode that the subtitles are timed accurately.</li>
</ul>
I am merely one person; but if you want to help, get started on it.<br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Where are these files sourced from?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> They are ripped directly from the RWBY BluRays released by RoosterTeeth.<br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>What tools did you use?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> <ul>
	<li> <a href="https://makemkv.com/">MakeMKV</a>: Rip contents of the BluRay discs to a digital format</li>
		<ul><li>Be sure to change minimum time to 0 so you can get all video files no matter the length.</li></ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.leawo.com/blu-ray-player/">Leawo BluRay Player</a>: Play BluRays as intended, allowing you to see titles of videos so you can name them correctly in the release. Wish I had something better, but this is all I can find that includes BluRay menus and does not just autoplay the files found on the disc.</li>
	<li> <a href="https://mkvtoolnix.download/">MKVToolNix</a>: Collection of tools used for MKV files. I mainly use it for separating English captions from English BluRays to add to Japanese BluRay releases.</li>
	<li> <a href="https://www.nikse.dk/SubtitleEdit/">SubtitleEdit:</a>: Best subtitle editor available. Really good at messing with offsets and doing basic subtitle work (this is necessary for portions of Japanese releases pre-V5 and full releases V5 and onwards).</li>
	<li> <a href="https://handbrake.fr/">Handbrake</a>: Encode video to decrease file sizes, include different tracks as well as name them, and do other QoL stuff.</li>
		<ul><li>Preset used is available <a href="https://rwbyg.com/RWBY_Preset.json">here.</a> Be sure to add audio and subtitle tracks as needed.</li></ul>
</ul><br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Where are the subtitles sourced from?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> They are ripped directly from the RWBY BluRays. And yes, I got ALL the subtitles available. RT is incredibly lazy and does not feel it worth their time to add the rest of the subtitles. However, you can pull subtitles off of RoosterTeeth and YouTube and put them in, but you'll have to retime the subtitles 99% of the time.<br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>How can I help this project?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> We need subtitles. A lot of them.
I need people who are able to do all of the following:
<ul>
	<li> Willing to learn ffmpeg (or a GUI application that uses ffmpeg)</li>
	<li> Willing to learn Subtitle Edit or some other subtitle editing program</li>
	<li> Willing to learn how to extract SRT files from RT's website</li>
	<li> Spend a lot of time getting the subtitles timed properly for every episode</li>
	<li> Share the finished file(s) to me for eventual transfer to MEGAnon</li>
</ul>
Alternatively, just <a href="https://paypal.me/czarchasm00">donate</a> so I can buy more BluRays.<br><br>

<a class="qst">Q:</a> <em>Can you provide raws, scans, extras, etc?</em><br>
<a class="ans">A:</a> Contact me on Discord and we will talk about what I can do for you.<br><br>

NOTE: BluRay extras and credits never have subtitles anywhere, so they are removed from this list.<br>
